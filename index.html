									<h2 class="major">ABOUT ME</h2>
									<p>I decided to venture into the world of tech by late 2020 and this was majorly due to the influence of my elder brother and the emergence of cool technological trends that I saw online. I have always been technologically inclined from a young age, I just needed the right nudge to help me along the path. I signed up for various tutorials including the famous Google IT Professional Certificate.
										
										
									I completed the entire course within 6 months and took my CompTIA A+ Examination where I was successful. 
									
									
									As of the future, I am already getting ready to learn other prominent programming languages such as Python, C++ and others.

									
									When my face isn't buried in the screen of my laptop so often, you will find me reading, playing football or watching other programmers explain code online.
